In this project we have tried to analyse the given data of the universities and cluster the universities into private and public. 

After doing a visualisation of the features and getting some scatter plots and histograms, we took one of the cells as the label of the data and droped it for the clustering task as it is considered as an unsupervised task. 
Then we inspected the cluster centers and evaluated how well the clustering was considering the fact that the ground truth was the column which was droped from the data (This is not a conventional way of how well our clustering was).
