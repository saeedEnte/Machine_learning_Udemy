In this project we have worked on a built-in dataset in seaborn. After visualising the features we have tried to train an SVM model to predict the species of the folowers. 
Then we evaluated the model using `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix`
Using the `grid_search` we have tried to find the best parameters for the C and gamma of the SVM classifier and finaly inspect the model with such parameters on the dataset.
